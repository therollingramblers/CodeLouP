        <p>Casey,</p>
        <p>TEverything you do
                You light the spark in my mood
                Taking me to places I have never been
                Beautiful won't you just let me in your world?
                I can taste the words on my tongue
                Your name might be the one word
                I never run away from
                I wanna shout to let me in your world
                Pretty miss there's an innocence I can't resist
                Can't dismiss so I wrote you a song and it goes like this:
                la la la la la la la la that ass though
                la la la la la la la la that ass though
                la la la la la la la la that ass though
                la la la la la la la la that ass though
                Everything you do
                You light the spark in my mood
                Taking me to places I have never been
                Beautiful won't you just let me in your world?
                You can be the only friend I confide in
                I'll give my heart to you
                I'll keep fightin' for the girl I love
                I'm no good for anybody else in this world
                I like it when you wear the jeans
                With the rips at the seams
                If you'd like to take them off, girl
                Then by all means (by all means)
                You're like my favorite cake (cake)
                I love the way you taste (taste)
                Never let you go to waste (no way)
                I'll even lick the plate ooo ooo ooo
                la la la la la la la la that ass though
                la la la la la la la la that ass though
                la la la la la la la la that ass though
                la la la la la la la la that ass though
                Everything you do
                You light the spark in my mood
                Taking me to places I have never been
                Beautiful won't you just let me in your world?
                You can be the only friend I confide in
                I'll give my heart to you
                I'll keep fightin' for the girl I love
