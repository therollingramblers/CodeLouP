        <p>Casey,</p>
        <p>Today is gonna be the day
                That they're gonna throw it back to you
                By now you should've somehow
                Realized what you gotta do
                I don't believe that anybody
                Feels the way I do, about you now
                Backbeat, the word was on the street
                That the fire in your heart is out
                I'm sure you've heard it all before
                But you never really had a doubt
                I don't believe that anybody
                Feels the way I do about you now
                And all the roads we have to walk are winding
                And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
                There are many things that I
                Would like to say to you but I don't know how
                Because maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me
                And after all, you're my wonderwall</p>
                <p>I love you!</p>
